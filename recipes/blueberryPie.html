        <h3>Steps to prepare Blueberry Pie</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the blueberries in the pastry shell and set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and salt. Add eggs and sour cream, stirring until blended. Pour the sour cream
            custard over the blueberries.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup flour. Cut in the butter with pastry blender until the mixture
            resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle the topping over the sour cream mixture and berries in the pie shell.</li>
