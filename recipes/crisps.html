        <h3>How to Make Crisp peach cobler</h3>
        <p>This recipe was inspired by one from Renee Erickson's in cookbook, 'A Boat, a Whale, and a Walrus.' It's a lot crispier
        than a regular cobbler, and you can use the technique for other fruit cobblers. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.</p>

        <h3>Steps to prepare Crisp peach cobler</h3>
        <ol>
            Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Crisp peach cobler:
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the rack under the middle rack to catch drips.
            Generously butter a 2-inch deep (2-quart) baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place peach sections into prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with lemon juice and zest.</li>
            <li>Stir butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Mix until creamed and resembles a sugary, buttery paste, 4 to 5
            minutes. Add oats and flour; stir until flour and oats are incorporated into the butter-sugar mixture and mixture
            resembles coarse crumbs, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour in milk; stir until mixture is wet and creamy, like a thick spreadable
            batter, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drop batter by spoonful on top of the peaches. Spread batter evenly over the surface of the peaches. Sprinkle 1/4 cup
            sugar on the batter. Spritz with water until sugar is wet and surface glistens.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven on middle rack until browned and crispy, about 45 minutes. Let cool at least 30 minutes before
            serving.</li>
        </ol>
